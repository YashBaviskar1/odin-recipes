            <ol>
                <li>To a small kadai or pan, dry roast the spices for kadai masala for 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat until fragrant.<em>Add more red chilies for a spicier masala.</em></li>
                <li>Remove kadai from heat and transfer the roasted spices to a spice grinder.</li>
                <li>Let it cool down a bit and then grind to a fine powder. Set aside. You can also make this kadai masala in advance and store it.</li>
                <li>In a large kadai or any other pan, now melt butter with oil on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and saute for 3 minutes until softened. Then add the sliced green chili and ginger garlic paste and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Then add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste. Mix and cook for around 6 minutes until tomatoes are really soft.</li>
                <li>Then add 3 to 4 teaspoons of the kadai masala that you prepared earlier (or add the whole thing if you like it spicy). Also add the garam masala, kashmiri red chili powder.</li>
                <li>Add half of the ginger julienne. Stir the spices and cook for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Then add 1/2 cup water and stir.</li>
                <li>Add cream, salt and sugar and mix. Cook for one minute.</li>
                <li>Add in the paneer and bell peppers (capsicum) and mix. Cover the pan or kadai with a lid and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on medium heat until bell peppers are slightly softened. You only want them half cooked here</li>
                <li>Crush kasuri methi and add to the pan.</li>
                <li>Garnish with remaining ginger julienne and cilantro.
